RAGA Workflow
A. Homologous species
    1. Correcting reference
    We utilize 'minimap2' to align the target PacBio HiFi reads with the target contigs for filtering out low-quality reads. Then, based on 'minimap2' and 'racon', the filtered target's PacBio HiFi reads are used to iteratively polish the reference genome, resulting in a mixed genome that closely resembles the target assembly.
    2. Alignment
    Using the mixed genome as a reference, target contigs are scaffolded by 'RagTag' to obtain target scaffolds. The mixed genome and target scaffolds are aligned using 'nucmer', and the result is then filtered and formatted with 'delta-filter' and 'show-coords'. The target PacBio HiFi reads were aligned to the mixed genome using 'Minimap2'.
    3. Partial assembly
    Based on the coordinates of each GAP, we extracted the high-quality alignment block from the mixed genome and the target PacBio HiFi reads that overlapped with it from the target assembly. Following that, the raw long sequences were obtained from the partial assembly using 'hifiasm'.
    4. Filtering
    With the assembly of each GAP, 1) Minimap2 was used to align PacBio HiFi reads to their corresponding assemblies, as well as eliminate assembly sequences that contained breakpoints. 2) We used Minimap2 to align the assembly sequences from the previous step with the contigs of the target, removing the assembly sequences that were identical to the target contigs. 3) Shorter assembly sequences were discarded, and the final long sequences were generated.

B. Closely related species
    1. Correcting reference
    Based on 'minimap2' and 'racon', the target's PacBio HiFi reads are used to iteratively polish the reference genome, resulting in a mixed genome that closely resembles the target assembly.
    2. Alignment
    We used ’minimap2‘ to align PacBio HiFi reads to the mixed genome, keeping the uniquely matched reads identified with the "tp:A:P" tag. The alignment regions of each filtered read were then merged using 'bedtools', removing shorter alignments in the process.
    3. Partial assembly
    The process is the same as that for homologous species.
    4. Filtering
    With the assembly of each GAP, 1) Minimap2 was used to align PacBio HiFi reads to their corresponding assemblies, as well as eliminate assembly sequences that contained breakpoints. 2) Shorter assembly sequences were discarded, and the final long sequences were generated.
