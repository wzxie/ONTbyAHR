RAGA Workflow
A. Same Species as Reference 
1. correcting reference
We employ minimap2 to compare the source PacBio HiFi reads with the source contigs, in order to filter out reads from potentially another haplotype. Then, based on minimap2 and racon, the filtered source PacBio HiFi reads are used to iteratively correct. The reference genome to obtain a mixed genome that is closer to the source assembly. 
2. alignment
Taking mixed genome as reference, source contigs is scaffolded by RagTag to obtain source scaffolds. The mixed genome and source scaffolds are aligned by nucmer, and the alignment is filtered and formatted by delta-filter and show-coords. Based on the location information of gaps output by RagTag, the extraction of alignment blocks near the gap areas is completed. Finally, RAGA will obtain high-quality alignment blocks with mixed genome located near the gaps of source scaffolds. 
3. partial hybrid assembly
Minimap2 was used to align source PacBio HiFi reads to mixed genome. According to the coordinates of high-quality alignment block in mixed genome, source PacBio HiFi reads that overlap with the block were extracted to obtain block source PacBio HiFi reads. According to the coordinates of high-quality alignment block in mixed genome, the corresponding mixed genome sequence was extracted as block PacBio ONT UL reads.
Hifiasm was used to perform partial hybrid assembly of block source PacBio HiFi reads and block source ONT UL reads for each block in turn to complete the generation of raw long sequences. 
4. filtering
Minimap2 was used to align each block source PacBio HiFi reads with its block assembly, and samtools was used to calculate the block alignment, filtering out block assembly sequences where block source PacBio HiFi reads cover breakpoints. Minimap2 was used to align the filtered block assembly sequences with source contigs, filtering out the block assembly sequences that were completely similar to and significantly different from source contigs. Finally, shorter block assembly sequences were filtered out to complete the generation of RAGA`s final long sequences.

B. Different species as reference 
1. correcting reference
RAGA uses source PacBio HiFi reads to iterate correct the reference genome based on minimap2 and racon to obtain a mixed genome that is closer to the source assembly. 
2. alignment
Using mixed genome as a reference, we performed alignment with source PacBio HiFi reads using minimap2. We filtered the alignment of each read, retaining only the alignment with the main alignment "tp:A:P" and the accurate alignment length accounting for 99% of the total length of the reads. We used bedtools to merge the alignment regions of each filtered read, filtering out shorter alignments. 
3. partial hybrid assembly
Same as the process with the same species as input. 
4. filtering
The minimap2 was used to align each block source PacBio HiFi reads with its block assembly, and samtools were used to statistically analyze the results, filtering out the block assembly sequences that had block source PacBio HiFi reads covering breakpoints. Finally, the shorter block assembly sequences were filtered out to complete the generation of RAGA's final long sequences.
